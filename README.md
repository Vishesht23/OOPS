# Library Management System (CLI in C++)

A command-line based Library Management System built in **C++**, designed to manage core library functions such as book lending, user tracking, fine calculation, and access-controlled operations — all without relying on external databases.

## 📌 Overview

This project showcases a fully functional library system built using core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and secure file-based persistence. It is ideal for small-scale library use-cases or as a learning reference for C++ OOP and file handling.

## 🎯 Objective

- Build a **C++ CLI Library Management System** for:
  - Book lending and returns
  - Fine calculation for late returns
  - User registration and tracking
  - Admin and user roles with restricted access

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts

- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts Used**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming: Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
  - File I/O for persistent data storage
  - Class-based design for modularity and clarity

## ⚙️ Features

- 📚 Book lending and return system  
- 👤 User authentication and tracking  
- 🔒 Role-based access (Admin/User)  
- 💰 Fine management for overdue books  
- 💾 Persistent file storage using `.txt` files  
- 📂 Secure and structured file handling  
- 🧱 No external libraries or databases required

## 💡 OOP Design Highlights

- `User` and `Admin` classes with inheritance
- Polymorphic behavior for user-specific and admin-specific operations
- Encapsulation for data protection and cleaner interfaces
- Modular file structure for easy extensibility

## ✅ Results

- Created a **robust CLI system** with:
  - **Persistent user data**
  - **Secure file handling**
  - **No external database dependencies**
